I've always been amazed by the amount of utility in the lodash library.  One each project I've worked on, each developer
seems to know one or two neat functions that I didn't realize were in there.  And I would some them one or two functions 
that they hadn't used.  So I thought it would be valuable to go through and use each of the functions there myself.  

This is a suite of tests that helped me explore the lodash library in a more comprehensive way.
